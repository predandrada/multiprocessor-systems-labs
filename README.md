# multiprocessor-systems-labs
My solutions to the SMP labs of http://acs.pub.ro/~cpop/SMP/

The projects include simulations and are presentation-ready ;)

Warning: project-1 was defined as project-lab-1, so it might need some refactoring, but renaming the directory before importing it in vivado should be enough. 

Good luck at SMP!
